ISDS 558 - Web Scrapping Job portal to gain Market Insights

Project Overview:
In a recent deep dive into the 2006 Credit Card Debt Crisis in Taiwan, unfolded a compelling narrative around two critical factors - the over-issuance of cards to unqualified applicants and the rampant overuse by holders, irrespective of their repayment ability.

1) Exploratory Data Analysis Highlights:
- 🚹 Male credit holders found in the minority.
- ⚠️ Defaulters outnumber non-defaulters by fourfold.
- 📊 Non-defaults feature a higher proportion of females aged 30-40.

2) Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:
- ✅ Conducted meticulous checks for missing values.
- 📊 Analyzed distributions for continuous variables.
- 🔄 Merged infrequent observations for a cleaner dataset.
- 🏷️ Applied label encoding for categorical variables.
- 📉 Generated a comprehensive correlation matrix.

3) Model Implementation: 
- Logistic Regression: 77.8% overall accuracy at a 0.5 cutoff.
- KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors):Achieved an impressive 79% overall accuracy at the 0.5 cutoff.
- Classification Tree Model: Emerged as the star player with an outstanding 83% overall accuracy at the 0.5 cutoff.

4) Project Culmination:
The project's pinnacle lies in the success of the Classification Tree model, boasting an 83% overall accuracy. These findings not only shed light on the past credit card crisis but also provide a robust framework for predicting and managing risks in similar financial scenarios.

Key Takeaways:
Data-driven decision-making is paramount, especially in navigating the intricate landscapes of financial crises.Project Overview: In a recent deep dive into the 2006 Credit Card Debt Crisis in Taiwan, unfolded a compelling narrative around two critical factors - the over-issuance of cards to unqualified applicants and the rampant overuse by holders, irrespective of their repayment ability.
